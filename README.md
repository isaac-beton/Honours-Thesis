# Honours-Thesis

In 2015, I conducted research into the mechanics of crumpling as part of my Honours Thesis for my Bachelor of Civil Engineering. 

Crumpling is a very mathematically complex field of research that has many real-world applications and potential - particularly in terms of energy absorbtion and lightweight thin-walled structures. For engineers to begin to design with any sort of materials, three variables are required:
1. Cross Sectional Geometric properties such as Cross Sectional Area or Section Modulus
2. Material properties such as Yield Stress or Ultimate Stress
3. Member Buckling modification factors

There did not appear to be any studies that attempted to directly correlate these variables with mechanical performance. Put simply, we wanted to be able to reliably determine how much Force a crumpled paper ball could resist for a given set of geometric properties.

I wrote the following pieces of code in MATLAB to:
1. Extract Geometric Properties from 3D scans
2. Correlate to Mechanical Test data
3. Determine Salient Geometric Properties
4. Plot Data
